# Project Euler Solutions (100DaysOfCode)

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from Project Euler. Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative problem-solving and programming skills.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

You can find the problems and more information about Project Euler on their official website: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Structure

Each problem solution is organized in a separate directory, named after the problem number. Inside each directory, you will find the solution code, along with any necessary input files or additional resources.
